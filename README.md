## Markov Does Country!

(This README is in progress)

We sometimes dream about being popular musicians. Let's use analytics to turn dream into reality. 

First, we went to Spotify API and pulled a list of some popular country songs. Next, we went to GENIUS API and pulled the lyrics of all these songs. Finally, we applied python and Markov chains to make a new work of country music art.

### Inputs
A whole truckload of the best Country songs.

### Analytics Tools
[Python](https://www.python.org/). [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify). [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/). [Genius](https://docs.genius.com/). And a bit of down-home country magic.

### Sample Output
You're just here for the party if I'm wrong then stop me from missing you and looking back
So girl I hope you know I really am
More than a California sunset
So girl I hope you know I really am
