## Let's Be a Musician!  - Generating Lyrics Using Markov Chain (temporary title)

(This README is in progress)

We sometimes dream about being popular musicians. Let's try to make this dream real in a way that the analytics could do. 
First, we went to Spotify API and pulled a list of some popular songs. Next, we went to GENIUS API and pulled the lyrics of all these songs. Finally, we applied python library, markopvify, to the lyrics and generate new lyrics.
